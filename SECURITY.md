## 🔐 Critical Security Features

### 1. Data Encryption at Rest

**PHI/PII Encryption:**
- Patient PHI (allergies, notes) encrypted using AES-256
- Prescription data (URLs, dosage, sig) encrypted
- Payment methods (Plaid tokens) encrypted
- Automatic encryption via database triggers

**Encryption Keys:**
- Stored in `encryption_keys` table with RLS enabled
- Recommended rotation: Every 90 days
- Admins can monitor key age in Security → Encryption tab

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Encryption happens automatically via triggers:
- encrypt_patient_phi_trigger (patients table)
- encrypt_prescription_trigger (order_lines table)
- Payment method encryption on insert/update
```

---

### 2. Row-Level Security (RLS)

**All sensitive tables have RLS enabled:**

| Table | Access Control |
|-------|----------------|
| `patients` | Practice-scoped, PHI protection |
| `order_lines` | Doctor/pharmacy/admin only |
| `practice_payment_methods` | Practice-owner + admin only |
| `encryption_keys` | Admin read-only |
| `audit_logs` | Admin read-only |
| `cart_lines` | Time-restricted (30 days) |

**Role-based access via `has_role()` function:**
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Uses security definer functions to avoid RLS recursion
- Roles stored in separate `user_roles` table

---

### 3. Comprehensive Audit Logging

**All sensitive actions are logged:**
- PHI access (patient records)
- Prescription access (order lines)
- Payment method access
- Authentication events
- Administrative actions
- Address verification changes

**Audit Log Features:**
- Automatic archival after 90 days → `audit_logs_archive`
- 6-year retention for HIPAA compliance
- Export to CSV for compliance reporting
- Real-time monitoring in Security dashboard

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Automatic logging via triggers on all sensitive tables
// Logs capture: user_id, user_email, user_role, action_type, entity_id, timestamp
```

## 🔒 Access Control Matrix

### Role Permissions

| Resource | Admin | Doctor | Provider | Pharmacy | Topline | Downline |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| All Patients | ✅ | Own Practice | Own Practice | Assigned Orders | Downline Practices | Assigned Practices |
| Order Lines | ✅ | Own Orders | Own Orders | Assigned Only | Downline Orders | Assigned Orders |
| **Profiles** | ✅ | **Own Only** | **Own Only** | Own Only | **Assigned Practices** | **Assigned Practices** |
| **Cart Lines** | ✅ | **Recent Only (30 days)** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Payment Methods | ✅ | Own Practice | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Audit Logs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Encryption Keys | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Security Dashboard | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Enhanced RLS Protections

**Profiles Table Security:**
- ✅ Users can only view their own profile by default
- ✅ Toplines can view profiles of practices assigned to them (via `linked_topline_id`)
- ✅ Downlines can view profiles of practices they're authorized for
- ✅ Prevents exposure of sensitive NPI/DEA/license numbers to unauthorized users
- ✅ Removed overly permissive "view associated profiles" policy

**Cart Lines Table Security:**
- ✅ Time-based access: Users can only view cart lines created within last 30 days
- ✅ Patient data masking function available (`mask_patient_data()`)
- ✅ Prevents long-term PHI exposure from abandoned carts
- ✅ Automatic expiration of sensitive temporary data

**Security Functions:**
```sql
-- Check if cart line is recent (within 30 days)
is_recent_cart_line(created_at timestamptz) → boolean

-- Mask patient data for non-owners
mask_patient_data(cart_id, name, email, phone) → jsonb

-- Log RLS policy violations
log_rls_violation(table_name, entity_id, action) → void
```

## 📊 Compliance & Reporting

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Monitor Security Dashboard Daily:**
   - Check security health score
   - Review recent errors
   - Verify encryption coverage

2. **Rotate Encryption Keys:**
   - Every 90 days (automatic warning)
   - Use Security → Encryption tab
   - Verify new key is active

3. **Review Audit Logs Weekly:**
   - Check for unusual PHI access patterns
   - Monitor cross-practice access attempts
   - Export logs for compliance

4. **Configure Alert Recipients:**
   - Add admin emails to alert rules
   - Test alert notifications
   - Set appropriate thresholds

### For Developers

1. **Never Disable RLS:**
   - All sensitive tables must have RLS
   - Use `has_role()` for permission checks
   - Test policies thoroughly

2. **Use Encryption Functions:**
   - PHI data: `encrypt_patient_phi()`
   - Prescriptions: `encrypt_prescription_data()`
   - Plaid tokens: `encrypt_plaid_token()`

3. **Log All Sensitive Actions:**
   - Use `log_audit_event()` function
   - Include entity_id and details
   - Capture user context

4. **Search Path on SECURITY DEFINER:**
   - Always add `SET search_path TO 'public'`
   - Prevents SQL injection
   - Required for production
