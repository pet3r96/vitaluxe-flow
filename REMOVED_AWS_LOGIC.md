# Removed AWS SES/SNS Logic - 2025-01-22

## Summary
Removed AWS-specific code for email (SES) and notifications (SNS).
All AWS SDK dependencies for email and SMS have been deprecated.

## ✅ Deleted Files
- `supabase/functions/send-verification-email/index.ts` - AWS SES email verification (deprecated)
- `supabase/functions/send-temp-password-email/index.ts` - AWS SES temp password emails (deprecated)
- `supabase/functions/send-welcome-email/index.ts` - AWS SES welcome emails (deprecated)

## ✅ Refactored Files
- `supabase/functions/send-2fa-code/index.ts`
  - ❌ Removed AWS SNS SMS sending logic
  - ✅ Preserved 2FA code generation and database storage
  - ✅ Preserved rate limiting logic
  - 🔧 TODO: Replace with Supabase/Twilio/GoHighLevel integration

- `supabase/functions/send-notification/index.ts`
  - ❌ Removed AWS SES email sending logic
  - ✅ Preserved Twilio SMS functionality (still active)
  - ✅ Preserved notification template logic and variable replacement
  - 🔧 TODO: Replace email sending with Supabase/Resend/SendGrid

## 🔒 Preserved Files (Not SES/SNS)
- `supabase/functions/get-s3-signed-url/index.ts` - S3 storage (untouched)
- `supabase/functions/upload-to-s3/index.ts` - S3 storage (untouched)

## 🧪 Test Results
- ✅ Verified no remaining usage of `@aws-sdk/client-ses`
- ✅ Verified no remaining usage of `@aws-sdk/client-sns`
- ✅ All Edge Functions still compile and deploy successfully
- ✅ S3 functionality (file storage) remains intact

## ✅ Env Vars to Remove
The following environment variables are no longer needed and can be safely removed:
- `AWS_REGION` (for SES/SNS only, keep if using S3)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (for SES/SNS only, keep if using S3)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (for SES/SNS only, keep if using S3)
- `SES_FROM_EMAIL` (deprecated)
- `SES_SOURCE_EMAIL` (deprecated)
- `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` (deprecated, if exists)

**Note:** If you're still using S3 for file storage (`get-s3-signed-url` and `upload-to-s3`), keep the AWS credentials.

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### What Still Works
- ✅ Twilio SMS notifications (in `send-notification`)
- ✅ S3 file storage and signed URL generation
- ✅ 2FA code generation and database storage
- ✅ Email verification token generation
- ✅ Notification template system and variable replacement

### What Needs Replacement
- ❌ Email verification emails (was AWS SES)
- ❌ Temp password emails (was AWS SES)
- ❌ Welcome emails (was AWS SES)
- ❌ 2FA SMS delivery (was AWS SNS)
- ❌ Notification email delivery (was AWS SES)

## 🚀 Recommended Replacements

### For Email (SES Replacement)
- **Supabase Auth Emails** - Built-in email templates for verification
- **Resend** - Developer-friendly email API
- **SendGrid** - Enterprise email service

### For SMS (SNS Replacement)
- **Twilio** - Already integrated in `send-notification`
- **GoHighLevel (GHL)** - If already in use elsewhere
- **Supabase OTP** - Native SMS/WhatsApp 2FA

## 📝 Notes
- All abstraction layers remain intact
- Function signatures preserved where possible
- Email/SMS formatting logic remains for easy replacement
- No breaking changes to database schema or RLS policies
- Supabase and GHL integrations remain untouched
- Future replacements can be slotted into the same abstraction layers
